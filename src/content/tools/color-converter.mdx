## Color Formats

**HEX** — A 6-digit hexadecimal code representing RGB values. Commonly used in CSS and web design. Example: `#3b82f6`

**RGB** — Red, Green, Blue values from 0-255 each. The standard for digital displays. Example: `rgb(59, 130, 246)`

**HSL** — Hue (0-360°), Saturation (0-100%), Lightness (0-100%). More intuitive for color adjustments. Example: `hsl(217, 91%, 60%)`

## When to Use Each

**HEX** is most common in web development and design tools. It's compact and widely supported.

**RGB** is useful when you need to work with color channels individually or when interfacing with graphics libraries.

**HSL** is best for making intuitive color adjustments — want a lighter shade? Increase lightness. Want less vibrant? Decrease saturation.

## Understanding HSL

**Hue** is the base color on the color wheel (0° = red, 120° = green, 240° = blue).

**Saturation** is color intensity. 0% is grayscale, 100% is fully saturated.

**Lightness** is brightness. 0% is black, 100% is white, 50% is the pure color.

## Tips

- Use the color picker for visual selection
- Adjust HSL sliders for intuitive modifications
- Click "Random" to discover new colors
- Copy any format directly to your clipboard

## CSS Usage

All three formats work in CSS:

```css
color: #3b82f6;
color: rgb(59, 130, 246);
color: hsl(217, 91%, 60%);
```

Modern CSS also supports alpha (transparency):

```css
color: #3b82f680; /* HEX with alpha */
color: rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.5); /* RGB with alpha */
color: hsla(217, 91%, 60%, 0.5); /* HSL with alpha */
```
