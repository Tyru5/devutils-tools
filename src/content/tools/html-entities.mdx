## What are HTML entities?

HTML entities are special codes that represent characters that have meaning in HTML or can't be easily typed. For example, `<` becomes `&lt;` to avoid being interpreted as a tag.

## Encoding modes

**Basic encoding** — Encodes only essential characters: `& < > " '`

**Encode all** — Also encodes Unicode characters and special symbols using numeric entities.

## Common HTML entities

| Character | Entity    | Description  |
| --------- | --------- | ------------ |
| `&`       | `&amp;`   | Ampersand    |
| `<`       | `&lt;`    | Less than    |
| `>`       | `&gt;`    | Greater than |
| `"`       | `&quot;`  | Double quote |
| `'`       | `&#39;`   | Single quote |
| `©`       | `&copy;`  | Copyright    |

## When to use HTML encoding

**Displaying code** — Show HTML/XML in a webpage without it being parsed.

**Form data** — Safely display user input to prevent XSS attacks.

**Special characters** — Ensure symbols display correctly across all browsers.

## Privacy

All encoding and decoding happens in your browser. Your data never leaves your device.
