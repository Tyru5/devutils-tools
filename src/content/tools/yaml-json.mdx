## What is YAML?

YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a human-readable data serialization format. It's commonly used for configuration files, especially in DevOps tools like Kubernetes, Docker Compose, and CI/CD pipelines.

## How to use this tool

1. Select conversion direction: **YAML → JSON** or **JSON → YAML**
2. Paste your data in the input area
3. Click **Convert**
4. Use **Swap** to switch input and output

## Common use cases

**Kubernetes configs** — Convert between YAML manifests and JSON for API calls.

**CI/CD pipelines** — GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and other tools use YAML configuration.

**API responses** — Some APIs accept YAML but return JSON, or vice versa.

**Configuration management** — Ansible, Terraform, and other tools use YAML configs.
