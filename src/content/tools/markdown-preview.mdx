## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. Created by John Gruber in 2004, it's widely used for README files, documentation, and writing for the web.

## How to Use

1. Type or paste markdown in the left editor
2. See real-time preview on the right
3. Drag and drop `.md` files to load them
4. Use Copy buttons to export markdown or HTML

## Supported Syntax

This tool supports GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM):

- **Bold**: `**text**` or `__text__`
- _Italic_: `*text*` or `_text_`
- ~~Strikethrough~~: `~~text~~`
- `Code`: `` `code` ``
- Links: `[text](url)`
- Images: `![alt](url)`
- Headers: `# H1` through `###### H6`
- Lists: `- item` or `1. item`
- Blockquotes: `> quote`
- Code blocks: triple backticks with language
- Tables: pipe-separated columns
- Task lists: `- [ ] task`

## Code Highlighting

Code blocks with language specifiers get syntax highlighting:

````
```javascript
const x = 42;
```
````

Supported languages include JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, HTML, CSS, and many more.

## Privacy

All processing happens locally in your browser. Your markdown content is never sent to any server.
