## How to use this tool

1. Paste your git diff output
2. Choose view format (Unified or Side by Side)
3. View highlighted changes

## View modes

**Unified** — Traditional diff view with additions and deletions inline.

**Side by Side** — Old and new versions displayed next to each other.

## Getting a diff

Generate a diff from git:

```bash
# Unstaged changes
git diff

# Staged changes
git diff --staged

# Between commits
git diff abc123 def456

# Specific file
git diff -- path/to/file.js
```

## Diff format

The tool expects unified diff format:

```diff
diff --git a/file.txt b/file.txt
--- a/file.txt
+++ b/file.txt
@@ -1,3 +1,4 @@
 unchanged line
-removed line
+added line
 unchanged line
```

## Color coding

| Color | Meaning           |
| ----- | ----------------- |
| Green | Added lines       |
| Red   | Removed lines     |
| Gray  | Unchanged context |
| Blue  | File headers      |
