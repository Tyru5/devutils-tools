## How to use this tool

1. Enter a numeric value (like `755`) or symbolic notation (like `rwxr-xr-x`)
2. Or click the permission grid to toggle individual permissions
3. Copy the result or the full command

## Permission types

| w      | 2     | Write — modify file or add/remove files in directory |
