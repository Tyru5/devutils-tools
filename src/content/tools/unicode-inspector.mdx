## How to use this tool

1. Type or paste text in the input field
2. Each character is analyzed automatically
3. View code points, encodings, and categories

## Information displayed

| Column     | Description                             |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Char       | Visual representation                   |
| Code Point | Unicode code point (U+XXXX and decimal) |
| UTF-8      | Byte representation in UTF-8            |
| UTF-16     | Code units in UTF-16                    |
| HTML       | HTML entity format                      |
| Category   | Unicode block/category                  |

## Understanding encodings

**UTF-8**: Variable-width encoding (1-4 bytes). ASCII characters use 1 byte, most emojis use 4 bytes.

**UTF-16**: Fixed-width encoding (2 or 4 bytes). Used internally by JavaScript strings.

**Code Point**: The unique number assigned to each character in the Unicode standard.

## Common use cases

**Debugging invisible characters** — Find hidden characters like zero-width spaces.

**Emoji analysis** — See how emojis are encoded (some are multiple code points).

**Internationalization** — Verify correct character handling in different scripts.

**Security** — Detect homograph attacks using similar-looking characters.

## Grapheme vs Code Point

A "grapheme" is what we perceive as a single character. Some graphemes consist of multiple code points:

- Emoji with skin tone: 👋🏽 = 👋 + 🏽 (2 code points)
- Accented letters: é = e + ́ (can be 2 code points)
- Flags: 🇺🇸 = 🇺 + 🇸 (2 regional indicators)
