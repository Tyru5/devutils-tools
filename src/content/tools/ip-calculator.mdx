## How to use this tool

1. Enter an IP address with CIDR notation (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`)
2. Click **Calculate**
3. View network details, host range, and more

## CIDR notation

CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) uses a suffix to indicate network size:

| CIDR | Netmask         | Hosts      |
| ---- | --------------- | ---------- |
| /8   | 255.0.0.0       | 16,777,214 |
| /16  | 255.255.0.0     | 65,534     |
| /24  | 255.255.255.0   | 254        |
| /25  | 255.255.255.128 | 126        |
| /30  | 255.255.255.252 | 2          |
| /32  | 255.255.255.255 | 1          |

## What you'll see

**Network Address** — First address in the range (network identifier)

**Broadcast Address** — Last address in the range

**First/Last Host** — Usable IP addresses for devices

**Usable Hosts** — Total addresses minus network and broadcast

## Private IP ranges

| Range       | CIDR | Purpose             |
| ----------- | ---- | ------------------- |
| 10.0.0.0    | /8   | Large networks      |
| 172.16.0.0  | /12  | Medium networks     |
| 192.168.0.0 | /16  | Home/small networks |
