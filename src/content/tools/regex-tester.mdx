## What is Regex?

Regular expressions (regex) are patterns used to match character combinations in text. They're powerful tools for searching, validating, and manipulating strings.

## How to Use

1. Enter your regex pattern in the first field
2. Set flags (g for global, i for case-insensitive, etc.)
3. Enter test text in the textarea
4. Matches are highlighted automatically

## Common Flags

| Flag | Name             | Description                          |
| ---- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `g`  | Global           | Find all matches, not just the first |
| `i`  | Case Insensitive | Match regardless of case             |
| `m`  | Multiline        | `^` and `$` match line boundaries    |
| `s`  | Dotall           | `.` matches newlines too             |
| `u`  | Unicode          | Enable full Unicode support          |

## Quick Reference

| Pattern  | Matches                            |
| -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `.`      | Any character except newline       |
| `\d`     | Any digit (0-9)                    |
| `\w`     | Word character (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, \_) |
| `\s`     | Whitespace (space, tab, newline)   |
| `^`      | Start of string/line               |
| `$`      | End of string/line                 |
| `*`      | Zero or more of previous           |
| `+`      | One or more of previous            |
| `?`      | Zero or one of previous            |
| `{n}`    | Exactly n of previous              |
| `{n,m}`  | Between n and m of previous        |
| `[abc]`  | Any character in brackets          |
| `[^abc]` | Any character NOT in brackets      |
| `(abc)`  | Capture group                      |
| `a\|b`   | a OR b                             |

## Common Examples

**Email**: `[\w.-]+@[\w.-]+\.\w+`

**Phone**: `\d{3}[-.]?\d{3}[-.]?\d{4}`

**URL**: `https?://[\w.-]+(?:/[\w.-]*)*`

**IP Address**: `\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}`

## Tips

- Escape special characters with `\` (e.g., `\.` for a literal dot)
- Use non-capturing groups `(?:...)` when you don't need the match
- Test with edge cases to ensure your pattern is robust
- Start simple and add complexity gradually
