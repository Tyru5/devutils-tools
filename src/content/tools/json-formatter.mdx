## What is JSON?

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data format used for storing and exchanging data. It's human-readable, easy to parse, and supported by virtually every programming language.

## How to use this tool

1. Paste your JSON into the input area on the left
2. Click **Format** to beautify with indentation or **Minify** to compress
3. The tool automatically validates your JSON and shows errors if any
4. Use the **Copy** button to copy the result to your clipboard
5. Choose your preferred indentation style (2 spaces, 4 spaces, or tabs)

## Common JSON errors

**Missing quotes around keys** — JSON requires double quotes around property names. `{name: "test"}` is invalid; use `{"name": "test"}`.

**Trailing commas** — JSON doesn't allow trailing commas. `{"a": 1,}` is invalid.

**Single quotes** — JSON only accepts double quotes for strings. `{'name': 'test'}` is invalid.

**Unquoted strings** — All string values must be in double quotes. `{"name": test}` is invalid.

## Is my data safe?

Yes. All processing happens locally in your browser. Your JSON is never sent to any server. You can verify this by disconnecting from the internet and using the tool — it will still work.

## Tips

- Use **Ctrl/Cmd + V** to paste and the tool will auto-detect JSON
- The validator shows exactly where errors occur in your JSON
- For very large files (10MB+), consider using a command-line tool like `jq`
