## What is a UUID?

A UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) is a 128-bit identifier that's guaranteed to be unique across space and time. Also known as GUIDs (Globally Unique Identifiers), UUIDs are used extensively in databases, distributed systems, and APIs.

## UUID Format

A standard UUID looks like this: `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000`

It consists of 32 hexadecimal characters displayed in 5 groups separated by hyphens, in the pattern `8-4-4-4-12`.

## UUID Versions

This tool generates **Version 4 UUIDs**, which are randomly generated. The "4" in the third group indicates the version:

- **v1** — Based on timestamp and MAC address
- **v4** — Random (this tool)
- **v5** — Based on namespace and name using SHA-1

Version 4 is the most commonly used because it requires no coordination or special hardware.

## How unique are they?

Extremely unique. The probability of generating two identical v4 UUIDs is astronomically low. You'd need to generate about 2.71 quintillion UUIDs to have a 50% chance of a collision.

## Options

**Uppercase** — Display UUIDs in uppercase letters (A-F instead of a-f).

**No dashes** — Remove the hyphens for a compact 32-character format.

**Bulk generation** — Generate up to 100 UUIDs at once.

## Use cases

- Database primary keys
- Session identifiers
- File naming
- Distributed system coordination
- API request tracking
