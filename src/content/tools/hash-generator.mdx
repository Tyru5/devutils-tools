## What is Hashing?

A hash function takes input data and produces a fixed-size string of characters, called a hash or digest. The same input always produces the same hash, but even a tiny change in the input produces a completely different hash.

## Supported Algorithms

**MD5** (128-bit) — Fast but cryptographically broken. Use only for checksums, not security.

**SHA-1** (160-bit) — Also considered insecure. Legacy use only.

**SHA-256** (256-bit) — Part of SHA-2 family. Widely used and secure for most purposes.

**SHA-512** (512-bit) — Strongest option. Recommended for password hashing and high-security applications.

## Common Uses

- **File integrity**: Verify downloads haven't been corrupted or tampered with
- **Password storage**: Store hashes instead of plaintext passwords
- **Data deduplication**: Identify duplicate files by comparing hashes
- **Digital signatures**: Part of cryptographic signing processes

## Important Notes

**Hashing is one-way.** You cannot reverse a hash to get the original input. This is by design.

**Hashes are deterministic.** The same input always produces the same output.

**Different inputs can produce the same hash** (collision), but this is extremely rare with secure algorithms like SHA-256.

## Don't Use For

- **Encryption**: Hashing is not encryption. You cannot decrypt a hash.
- **MD5/SHA-1 for security**: These algorithms have known vulnerabilities.

## Privacy

All hashing happens locally in your browser using the Web Crypto API. Your data never leaves your device.
