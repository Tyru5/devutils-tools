## What is the Workflow Builder?

The Workflow Builder lets you chain multiple data transforms together into a pipeline. Instead of copying output from one tool and pasting it into another, you can create a sequence of transforms that run automatically.

## How to use this tool

1. Enter your input data in the input area
2. Click **Add Transform** to add steps to your chain
3. Reorder steps by dragging or using the up/down arrows
4. Click **Run Chain** to execute all transforms in sequence
5. View intermediate results by expanding each step
6. **Save** your workflow to reuse it later
7. **Share** your workflow via URL with others

## Available Transforms

**Encode/Decode**

- Base64 Encode/Decode
- URL Encode/Decode
- HTML Entities Encode/Decode
- Escape/Unescape strings

**Format**

- JSON Format (prettify)
- JSON Minify
- JSON Parse (for escaped JSON strings)

**Hash**

- MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512

**Text**

- Uppercase, Lowercase
- Trim whitespace
- Reverse string

**Convert**

- YAML ↔ JSON
- CSV → JSON
- TOML ↔ JSON
- JWT Decode (extract payload)

## Example Workflows

**Decode nested Base64 + JSON**

1. Base64 Decode
2. JSON Format

Great for decoding JWT payloads or API responses.

**Extract and hash JWT claims**

1. JWT Decode
2. JSON Minify
3. SHA-256 Hash

Useful for creating cache keys from token content.

**Convert and format config files**

1. YAML to JSON
2. JSON Format

Perfect for comparing YAML configs in JSON format.

## Saving & Sharing

Your saved workflows are stored in your browser's localStorage and will persist across sessions. They never leave your device.

Share workflows via URL by clicking the **Share** button. The URL encodes only the transform chain, not your data — your input is never shared.

## Is my data safe?

Yes. All processing happens locally in your browser. Your data is never sent to any server. Saved workflows are stored only in your browser's localStorage.
