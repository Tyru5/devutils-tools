## What is a JWT?

A JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe way to transmit information between parties. JWTs are commonly used for authentication and authorization in web applications.

## JWT Structure

A JWT consists of three parts separated by dots:

```
header.payload.signature
```

**Header**: Contains the token type and signing algorithm (e.g., HS256, RS256).

**Payload**: Contains claims — statements about the user and additional metadata.

**Signature**: Verifies the token hasn't been tampered with.

## Common Claims

| Claim | Name       | Description                     |
| ----- | ---------- | ------------------------------- |
| `iss` | Issuer     | Who created the token           |
| `sub` | Subject    | Who the token is about          |
| `aud` | Audience   | Who the token is intended for   |
| `exp` | Expiration | When the token expires          |
| `nbf` | Not Before | When the token becomes valid    |
| `iat` | Issued At  | When the token was created      |
| `jti` | JWT ID     | Unique identifier for the token |

## Security Warning

This tool **decodes** but does not **verify** JWTs. Anyone can decode a JWT — the signature verification is what provides security.

**Never trust a JWT without verifying its signature on your server.**

## Privacy

All decoding happens locally in your browser. Your tokens are never sent to any server.

## When to Use JWTs

- Stateless authentication in APIs
- Single Sign-On (SSO) between services
- Securely transmitting information between parties
- Short-lived access tokens

## When NOT to Use JWTs

- Storing sensitive data (JWTs are encoded, not encrypted)
- Long-lived sessions (use server-side sessions instead)
- Situations requiring immediate token revocation
