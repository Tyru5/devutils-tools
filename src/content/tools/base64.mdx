## What is Base64?

Base64 is a binary-to-text encoding scheme that represents binary data using 64 ASCII characters. It's commonly used to embed images in HTML/CSS, transmit data in URLs, and encode email attachments.

## How to use this tool

1. Select **Encode** or **Decode** mode
2. Paste your text or Base64 string into the input area
3. Click the action button to convert
4. Use **Swap** to quickly switch input and output
5. Click **Copy** to copy the result

## Common use cases

**Embedding images** — Convert images to Base64 data URIs for inline embedding in HTML or CSS.

**API authentication** — Many APIs use Base64-encoded credentials in authorization headers.

**Data transmission** — Safely transmit binary data through text-only channels like JSON or XML.

**Email attachments** — MIME encoding uses Base64 for email attachments.

## UTF-8 support

This tool properly handles UTF-8 characters. Emojis, accented characters, and other Unicode text will encode and decode correctly.

## Is it encryption?

No. Base64 is an encoding scheme, not encryption. Anyone can decode Base64 — it provides no security. Never use Base64 alone to protect sensitive data.

## Privacy

All encoding and decoding happens in your browser. Your data never leaves your device.
