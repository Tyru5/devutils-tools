## What is a Unix Timestamp?

A Unix timestamp (also called Epoch time or POSIX time) is the number of seconds that have elapsed since January 1, 1970, at 00:00:00 UTC. This date is known as the "Unix Epoch."

For example, the timestamp `1705600000` represents January 18, 2024, at 8:26:40 PM UTC.

## Seconds vs Milliseconds

Unix timestamps traditionally use **seconds**, but JavaScript and many modern systems use **milliseconds**. You can tell the difference by the number of digits:

- **Seconds**: 10 digits (e.g., `1705600000`)
- **Milliseconds**: 13 digits (e.g., `1705600000000`)

This tool auto-detects which format you're using, or you can manually toggle milliseconds mode.

## Common Uses

- **Databases**: Storing dates as integers for easy sorting and comparison
- **APIs**: Transmitting dates in a timezone-agnostic format
- **Logging**: Recording precise event times
- **Cache invalidation**: Setting expiration times

## Year 2038 Problem

32-bit systems store Unix timestamps as signed integers, which will overflow on January 19, 2038, at 03:14:07 UTC. This is similar to the Y2K bug. Most modern systems use 64-bit timestamps, which won't overflow for billions of years.

## Quick Reference

| Timestamp  | Date                         |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- |
| 0          | January 1, 1970 (Unix Epoch) |
| 1000000000 | September 9, 2001            |
| 1234567890 | February 13, 2009            |
| 2000000000 | May 18, 2033                 |
