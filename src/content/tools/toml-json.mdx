## What is TOML?

TOML (Tom's Obvious Minimal Language) is a configuration file format that's easy to read and write. It's widely used in Rust projects (Cargo.toml), Python projects (pyproject.toml), and other modern tooling.

## How to use this tool

1. Select conversion direction: **TOML → JSON** or **JSON → TOML**
2. Paste your configuration data
3. Click **Convert**
4. Use **Swap** to switch input and output

## Common use cases

**Rust projects** — Convert Cargo.toml for programmatic manipulation.

**Python packaging** — Work with pyproject.toml configuration.

**Hugo sites** — Convert Hugo's TOML config to JSON.

**Configuration migration** — Move between TOML and JSON-based tools.

## TOML features

- **Tables**: Sections defined with `[section.name]`
- **Arrays**: Inline `[1, 2, 3]` or multi-line
- **Dates**: Native datetime support
- **Comments**: Full comment support with `#`

## Example

```toml
[package]
name = "my-app"
version = "1.0.0"

[dependencies]
serde = "1.0"
```

Converts to:

```json
{
  "package": {
    "name": "my-app",
    "version": "1.0.0"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "serde": "1.0"
  }
}
```
