## What is this tool?

This tool converts JSON data into TypeScript interface definitions. It analyzes the structure of your JSON and generates properly typed interfaces that you can copy directly into your TypeScript projects.

## How to use this tool

1. Paste your JSON into the input area on the left
2. Click **Convert** to generate TypeScript interfaces
3. Customize the output using the options below:
   - **Root name**: Change the name of the root interface (default: `Root`)
   - **Export**: Add `export` keyword to interfaces
   - **Use type**: Generate `type` aliases instead of `interface`
   - **Readonly**: Add `readonly` modifier to all properties
   - **Optional properties**: Add `?` to make all properties optional
4. Use the **Copy** button to copy the generated TypeScript

## Type inference rules

The tool automatically infers TypeScript types from JSON values:

| JSON Value | TypeScript Type |
|------------|-----------------|
| `"text"` | `string` |
| `123`, `1.5` | `number` |
| `true`, `false` | `boolean` |
| `null` | `null` |
| `[]` (empty) | `unknown[]` |
| `[...]` | Inferred element type with `[]` |
| `{...}` | Named interface |

## Features

**Nested objects** are automatically extracted into separate interfaces with meaningful names derived from the property key.

**Arrays** are analyzed to determine the element type. If an array contains objects, they're merged into a single interface. Mixed-type arrays generate union types like `(string | number)[]`.

**Special property names** containing spaces or special characters are automatically quoted in the output.

## Common use cases

- Converting API responses to TypeScript types
- Generating types from JSON configuration files
- Creating interfaces from sample data
- Quick prototyping with real JSON data

## Is my data safe?

Yes. All processing happens locally in your browser. Your JSON is never sent to any server. You can verify this by disconnecting from the internet and using the tool — it will still work.

## Tips

- Start with a representative JSON sample that includes all possible fields
- Use the "Optional properties" option when your JSON might have missing fields
- For API responses, consider adding `export` for easy importing in your project
- If you have multiple JSON samples, merge them first to capture all possible properties
