## What is URL Encoding?

URL encoding (also called percent-encoding) converts characters into a format that can be safely transmitted in a URL. Special characters are replaced with a `%` followed by their hexadecimal value.

For example, a space becomes `%20`, and `&` becomes `%26`.

## Component vs Full URL

**Component encoding** (`encodeURIComponent`) encodes all special characters, including `/`, `?`, and `&`. Use this for individual query parameter values.

**Full URL encoding** (`encodeURI`) preserves URL structure characters like `/`, `?`, `&`, and `=`. Use this for complete URLs where you want to keep the structure intact.

## When to use which?

**Use Component for:**

- Query parameter values
- Path segments that might contain special characters
- Any user input that will be part of a URL

**Use Full URL for:**

- Complete URLs that are already properly formed
- URLs where you only need to encode spaces and international characters

## Examples

| Input          | Component          | Full URL        |
| -------------- | ------------------ | --------------- |
| `hello world`  | `hello%20world`    | `hello%20world` |
| `a=1&b=2`      | `a%3D1%26b%3D2`    | `a=1&b=2`       |
| `path/to/file` | `path%2Fto%2Ffile` | `path/to/file`  |

## Privacy

All encoding and decoding happens locally in your browser. No data is sent to any server.
